@article{Podmore2010,
abstract = {The implementation of highly realistic real-time, massive, online, multi-time frame simulations is proposed as a means for building a common vision of smart grid functions among politicians, regulators, managers, operators, engineers, and technicians. These massive simulations will include hundreds of participants that play roles of reliability coordinators, transmission operators, distribution operators, power plant operators, and substation operators. These highly visible drills can demonstrate how the new smart grid systems, people, and processes can all work together economically and reliably. The industry, especially smart grid system designers, can get feedback from low cost, safe, and easily configurable simulations instead of waiting for expensive and hardwired deployments. Direct load control of millions of customer appliances is identified as a silver bullet to build self-healing and maximal flow smart grids that can accommodate large penetrations of intermittent wind and solar
generation and rapid load growth due to plug-in electric vehicles. The paper recommends that up to 50\% of load be controlled with minimal inconvenience to customers to potentially enhance angle, voltage, frequency, and thermal stability. An expert operator decision model is described with a view to helping system developers build operator-centered and friendly smart grid control systems.},

abstract = {Smart grid technology is progressing worldwide. Various Countries are investing to transform their traditional power grid to Smart grid. They have started realigning their organization to support a Smart grid vision. At this initial stage some software models are required to quantifiably evaluate, monitor the progress and plan for the realization of a smart grid. At present some models like Smart Grid Interoperability Maturity Model, Smart Grid Investment Model, Smart Grid Maturity Model and Smart Grid Conceptual Model are available. Smart Grid Interoperability Maturity Model is used to measure the current status of automation in the areas like transmission, distribution and demand side resources. The Smart Grid Investment Model is used in calculating different smart grid investments, along with their strategies. Smart Grid Maturity model is used in planning of utilities in smart grid transformation; prioritize the tasks and measuring their progress at every stage. Smart Grid Conceptual Model is
used to analyze different standards and interoperations of smart grid development. A new proposed Smart Grid Monitoring Model will help in understanding smart grid deployment and capability within electric utility companies.},

abstract = {Many believe the electric power system is undergoing a profound change driven by a number of needs. There's the need for environmental compliance and energy conservation. We need better grid reliability while dealing with an aging infrastructure. And we need improved operational effi ciencies and customer service. The changes that are happening are particularly signifi cant for the electricity distribution grid, where "blind" and manual operations, along with the electromechanical components, will need to be transformed into a "smart grid." This transformation will be necessary to meet environmental targets, to accommodate a greater emphasis on demand response (DR), and to support plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as well as distributed generation and storage capabilities. It is safe to say that these needs and changes present the power industry with the biggest challenge it has ever faced. On one hand, the transition to a smart grid has to be evolutionary to keep the lights on; on the
other hand, the issues surrounding the smart grid are signifi cant enough to demand major changes in power systems operating philosophy.},

abstract = {Increasing complexity of power grids, growing demand, and requirement for greater reliability, security and efficiency as well as environmental and energy sustainability concerns continue to highlight the need for a quantum leap in harnessing communication and information technologies. This leap toward a \^{A}¿smarter\^{A}¿ grid is widely referred to as \^{A}¿smart grid.\^{A}¿ A framework for cohesive integration of these technologies facilitates convergence of acutely needed standards, and implementation of necessary analytical capabilities. This paper critically reviews the reliability impacts of major smart grid resources such as renewables, demand response, and storage. We observe that an ideal mix of these resources leads to a flatter net demand that eventually accentuates reliability challenges further. A gridwide IT architectural framework is presented to meet these challenges while facilitating modern cybersecurity measures. This architecture supports a multitude of geographically and
temporally coordinated hierarchical monitoring and control actions over time scales from milliseconds and up.},

abstract = {Exciting yet challenging times lie ahead. The electrical power industry is undergoing rapid change. The rising cost of energy, the mass electrification of everyday life, and climate change are the major drivers that will determine the speed at which such transformations will occur. Regardless of how quickly various utilities embrace smart grid concepts, technologies, and systems, they all agree onthe inevitability of this massive transformation. It is a move that will not only affect their business processes but also their organization and technologies.},

@inproceedings{Podmore2010a,
abstract = {This paper addresses how future Smart Grid measurement, analysis and control technologies could be applied to significantly enhance methods for system restoration. The paper reviews the common phases for system restoration from system assessment, creation of restoration building blocks, expansion of islands, re-integration with neighboring systems through to customer load restoration. A number of novel restoration concepts including phasor based state and topology estimation, automatic island frequency control, virtual synchro-scopes, simultaneous line end energization, simultaneous generator synchronization, stabilization of parallel plant units and temporary low voltage operation of transmission lines are presented. The concepts in general are based upon applying smarter computer, communication and control processes while minimizing the need for capital investment in transmission equipment. These concepts will allow EHV lines to be energized at a much earlier phase in the restoration process.
This in turn will allow electrical islands to be formed more rapidly with much greater capacity and geographic scope. As a consequence restoration times could be reduced from days to hours. The ideas are presented at this stage as concepts rather than methods. The concepts have been tested with very preliminary simulations and appear promising. Significant more study is required to further validate the feasibility of each concept with detailed simulations and analyses with due consideration to all the practical issues including control, communication, security, impact on protection systems, impact on operating procedures and consequences of false operations.},

@inproceedings{Jain2011,
abstract = {We have recently proposed 3-D intelligent sensors for the power grid with a view toward helping improve its reliability and restoration capability. Our solution is to use a matrix of fault tolerant distributed sensors that can sense as well as take local actions. These new sensors are "3-D Heterogeneous Sensor System on a Chip (HSoC)", which can potentially overcome delays and domino effects. The paper specifically focuses on the application of the 3-D HSoCs for fault-distance estimation and the issues involved in the failure of such devices - due to defects both within the chip and due to external stress. We show that the use of multiple devices brings benefits relating to both the detection and accuracies of fault distance and arc voltage estimates. Specifically, if the nearest device is located at -x relative to the location of the transmission line fault, then the use of additional devices at -D-x, D-x, and 2D-x diminishes the probability of loss of detection considerably. The paper presents
studies on this fault tolerance, as well as accuracy of estimation, vs. the number of devices used for collaborative detection. It is important to note that this collaboration does not require additional sensors, only communication among them. Matrixed HSoCs can provide several fold improvement over single HSoC.},

abstract = {Fault diagnosis in power distribution systems is critical to expedite the restoration of service and improve the reliability. With power grids becoming smarter, more and more data beyond utility outage database are available for fault cause identification. This paper introduces basic methodologies to integrate and analyze data from different sources. Geographic information system (GIS) provides a framework to integrate these data through spatial and temporal relations. Features extracted from raw data provide different discriminant powers, which can be evaluated by the likelihood measure. A fault cause classifier is then trained to learn the relations between fault causes and the features. Two statistical methods, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and logistic regression (LR), are introduced. The assumptions, general approaches and performances of these two techniques are discussed and evaluated on a real-world outage dataset.},

The algorithm tries to balance the load served by the individual substations in the post fault restoration strategy. The proposed algorithm is essentially a constructive network tracing algorithm which comes up with final network restoration strategy by determining the switching sequences of the feeder switches like circuit breakers, sectionalizers, etc. Simple example systems are considered to demonstrate the algorithm. The algorithm is considered to be applicable to the smart grids in which reliability of the supply is a major concern.},

In this paper we propose a method that is based on coordination and negotiation among a set of distributed local power committees who could together reach a consensus of ?global? optimal power restoration solution in cope with local power failures after a fault is detected in a power grid. The optimality criteria can be specified by a human power manager in terms of actual operation costs such as the minimum number of switch actions. We show how local distributed agent committees whose members are essentially switch agents and power generator agents are connected locally as neighbors and can find a global optimal solution to the power restoration problem by localizing their decisions in the local committee and by communicating and negotiating via neighbors of their committee members.},

This restoration system is designed to be linked to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. A rule based system is used to generate a hypothesis in fault diagnosis to identify the type of fault and its location. The fast restoration algorithm with built-in multiple search for all possible links to connect the dead islands in the network is augmented by a load flow simulation. It thus enables a very fast and total restoration of supply with a minimum of switching actions. The additional step-by-step partial restoration algorithm will further restore supply, utilizing up to the maximum capacity of the distribution system. The proposed restoration system can be implemented on an existing SCADA system to provide a restoration guide for an operator or for automatic restoration.},
